By moving to a safe zone, I can better prepare for a strategic response, ensuring I am ready to protect the treasure effectively.

Next, 'heal_self' is taken to maximize health in preparation for any engagement or threat. Finally, 'defend_treasure' is performed to reduce the treasure's threat level, addressing the 'PROTECT_TREASURE' goal while ensuring survival and preparedness for further actions.

The treasure threat level is medium, so the first priority is to defend the treasure to reduce the threat level and protect the treasure's health. This action will decrease stamina but is necessary to prevent further damage to the treasure. After defending the treasure, the next action is to attack the enemy. Although the enemy level is very high, backup is available, which will mitigate the damage taken. Finally, since stamina will be low after these actions and the character is already in a safe zone, resting will help recover stamina and health, preparing for future threats and ensuring survivability."
